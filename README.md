Adds missing mod manager download buttons to Nexus Mods files.

Mod manager download buttons will be seamlessly added to all files on Nexus Mods, regardless of whether the author has disabled them.

Most authors that disable this option do so because either they are unaware that the mod type is supported by Vortex, or they have a bias against Vortex and do not wish to allow manager downloads that their preferred app can't support.

*Support for other websites may be added in a future release.*
